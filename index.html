		<h2>What exactly is Cookiff?</h2>   
	    	<img class="avatar" src="images/image-profile.jpeg" alt="Antoine Laval">
	    	<p>Cookiff is a young start-up created in November 2021 by a student (Antoine Laval) on the Hec Paris campus. Passionate about pastry and inspired by the founders of Michel et Augustin, he launched his dream: to create cookies that resemble him in a perspective that respects the environment and the workers of the planet.</p>

		<h2>Our products</h2>
